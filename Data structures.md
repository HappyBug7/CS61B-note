# Lecture 1
## Overview
61B features:
- Write code that runs efficiently
	- Good algorithms
	- Good data structures
- Writing code efficiently
	- Designing, building, testing, and debugging large programs
	- Use of programming tools
		- git, IntelliJ, JUnit
	- Java
- The most popular topics for job interview questions in software engerning
	- Hash tables, binary search, ...
- Some really cool math
	- Asymptotic analysis
	- Resizing arrays...

## Phases
- Phase 1 (weeks 1-4): intro to Java and Data Structures
	- All coding work is solo
	- Moves VERY Fast
- Phase 2 (weeks 5-10): Data Structures
	- All coding work is solo
	- Moves moderately
- Phase 3 (week 12-14): Algorithms
	- Coding works is entriely dedicated to final project, done in pairs
	- Slower pace

## Java Basis
- Functions must be decleared as a part of a class in Java. A function that is part of a class is called a "method". So in Java, all functions are methods
- to define a function in Java, we use `public static`. We will see alternate ways of defining functions later
- All parameters of a function must have a decleared type. Functions in Java return only one value.
- Java is an object oriented langurage
	- Every Java file must conatin a class declaration
	- All code lives inside a class, even helper functions, global constants, etc.
	- To run a Java program, you typically define a main method using `public static void main(string[] args)`
- Java is statically typed
	- All variables, parameters, and methods must have a decleared type
	- That type can never change
	- Expression also have a type
	- The compiler checks that all the types in your program are compatible before the program ever runs
